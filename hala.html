	 Hi, my name is Hala El Kachtoul, I am a Speech-Language Pathologist.
     Having had the chance to start volunteering with the global organization "Operation Smile" as a SLP since my first year of studies, I now understand, more than ever, the impact of a simple act of therapy on the entirety of someone's life. And to carry on this impact, I am all ready and motivated to start a journey full of adventures, discoveries, passion and love for my profession and patients.

     <h2>What is Speech and Language Pathology?</h2>
      <p>
	  Speech and Language Pathology (SLP) is specialty belonging to the medical field. It allows diagnosing and treating disorders and delays effecting the speech, language or communication.

	  This specialty is also strongly linked to the psychology, as it is a very important aspect of the overall management of a given case.

     <h2>What do I like about my profession?</h2>
     <p>
	  To me, being a SLP is more like a pure passion. Believing that I have the superpowers to help my angelic patients and to reassure their parents is the most amazing feeling I have ever felt.
     </p>
     <p>
	  Being a SLP has definitly taught me to appreciate the smallest victories, such as hearing one tiny syllable from one of my non verbal patients with autism, helping a patient with VPI produce a correct "S" sound, seeing an apraxic patient swell his cheeks or noticing the tiniest reaction to sounds from a patient with deafness and the list goes on... 
     </p>
     <p>
	  I also learnt that doing my job with pure love is the key to succeed in what I do. 
	  I learnt to be a kid when working with my patients; I jump, run around, play silly, simple and modest games to enter their tiny but wonderful worlds.
	  I learnt to be a wise and reassuring therapist when the parents need my advice, orientations or guidance.
	  I learnt to look into what's inside rather than appearences.
	  I learnt to voluteer, to give without expecting anything in return.
	  I learnt to be greathful...
	  I learnt that sometimes less is much more!
